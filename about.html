    <p class="about__article__text">Before it aired on television, Spongebob Squarepants had began as an educational comic strip, drawn by marine biologist Stephen Hillenburg. Hillenburg had created the comic while working at the Orange County Marine Institute in an attempt to teach kids about tide pools. After realizing his passion for the arts, he went back to school to study experimental animation at the California Institute for the arts. in 1996, Hillenburg pitched the project he was working on--entitled Sponge Boy--to Nickelodeon, who accepted it on the spot. The title character's name had to be changed due to a copyright issue. The first episode of Spongebob Squarepants aired on May 1, 1999.</p>
