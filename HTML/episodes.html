 <h2 class= "episodes_article_header">There are 248 episodes across 13 seasons!</h2>
    <article class="episodes_article">
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">Spongebob Squarepants is the longest running animated show in Nickelodeon’s history. It is also one of the longest running children’s programs in all of television history.</p>

      <p class= "episodes_article_text">In its 277 episodes across 13 seasons, the still-running TV show has had many iconic moments that are quotable by the good majority of Gen Z’ers. Most of those are couched in the golden (see what I did there) years of the show, which ran through the show’s first three seasons.</p>

      <p class= "episodes_article_text">
        These are the five episodes from those seasons that are much watch television and are recommendable to any age group.
        </p>

      <h3 class= "episodes_article_subhead">Chocolate With Nuts (Season 3, Episode 12)
      </h3>
      <img class="episodes_article_img" src="../assets/chocolate.gif" width= 200px height= auto>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">In this episode, Spongebob and Patrick decide to become door-to-door chocolate salesmen. On their journey, they encounter a young couple that seems a little too into chocolate, a salesman who sells them chocolate bar carrying bags, and two older women (one of them looks like a raisin).</p>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">This episode included one of the most iconic lines in the show, when the raisin lady expressed her feelings about chocolate.
      </p>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">“Chocolate. I remember when they first invented chocolate. Sweet, sweet chocolate. I always hated it!”
      </p>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">After her line, the entrepreneurs learn the secret of business - lying. They tell them rubbing the chocolate on their skin will make them look younger, and begin selling chocolate bars hand over foot.
      </p>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">At the end of the episode, the two gentlemen take the two women on a date to a fancy restaurant with their new found riches. Classy.
      </p>

      <h3 class= "episodes_article_subhead">Pizza Delivery (Season 1, Episode 5)</h3>
      <img class="episodes_article_img" src="../assets/pizza.gif" width= 300px height= auto>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">Tasked with delivering the first-ever Krusty Krab pizza, SpongeBob and Squidward embark on a journey across Bikini Bottom that tests their metal and patience.</p>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">The episode establishes the character dynamics between the two characters. While Squidward is fed up with SpongeBob throughout the journey, he is also protective of him, standing up for him when he is eventually bullied by the customer that ordered the pizza. </p>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">It also establishes running gags, like SpongeBob’s inability to drive boats (although he drives a rock just fine in the episode), and carries more quotable lines (like SpongeBob’s iconic jingle “the Krusty Krab pizza, is the pizza, for you and me”).</p>

      <h3 class= "episodes_article_subhead">Ripped Pants (Season 1, Episode 2)</h3>
      <img class="episodes_article_img" src="../assets/pants.gif" width= 300px height= auto>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">SpongeBob rips his pants at the beach while trying to lift marshmallow dumbbells. After being made fun of by everyone, he writes a Beach Boys-inspired song about how he ripped his pants and now no girls want him.</p>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">One could only wish they had the guts to turn an embarrassing moment into a chart-worthy tune. This episode established SpongeBob as the chad he is.</p>

      <h3 class= "episodes_article_subhead">Graveyard Shift (Season 2, Episode 16)</h3>
      <img class="episodes_article_img" src="../assets/graveyard.gif" width= 300px height= auto>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">When Mr. Krabs tasks his employees with working the night shift, Squidward scares SpongeBob by making up the tale of the “Hash-Slinging Slasher” who’s appearance is foretold by three warning signs: flickering lights, a call with no one on the line and the arrival of a bus at the Krusty Krab. But when all three things start happening, even Squidward starts getting scared.</p>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">The call and the bus are explained away by a nervous job applicant. The final reveal of the episode is that Nosferatu is the cause of the flickering lights, which for some reason doesn’t scare the crew at all. This type of nonsensical humor is commonplace with the show.</p>

      <h3 class= "episodes_article_subhead">Band Geeks (Season 2, Episode 15)</h3>
      <img class="episodes_article_img" src="../assets/bandgeek.gif" width= 300px height= auto>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">Squidward is trying to meet the expectations of his jerk of a rich boy high school rival Squilliam Fancyson by showing he has a band and is a successful conductor. Only he doesn’t have a band.</p>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Pearl, Mrs. Puff and many other recurring characters all agree to help him. Problem is they suck. Squidward becomes dejected and gives up.
      </p>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">The sponge won’t let Squidward down. He rallies the troops, they practice as hard as they can. When Squidward shows up to perform with the band (at a non-official version of the Super Bowl), his jaw hits the ground when they mount one of the best performances of all time.

      </p>
      <p class= "episodes_article_text">To see how good they do, you just have to watch it yourself.
