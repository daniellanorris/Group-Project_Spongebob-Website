    <p class="about__article__text">Before it aired on television, Spongebob Squarepants had began as an educational comic strip, drawn by marine biologist Stephen Hillenburg. Hillenburg had created the comic while working at the Orange County Marine Institute in an attempt to teach kids about tide pools. After realizing his passion for the arts, he went back to school to study experimental animation at the California Institute for the arts. in 1996, Hillenburg pitched the project he was working on--entitled Sponge Boy--to Nickelodeon, who accepted it on the spot. The title character's name had to be changed due to a copyright issue. The first episode of Spongebob Squarepants aired on May 1, 1999.</p>

        <p class="about__article__text">The premise of Spongebob Squarepants is following a set of sea-dwelling creatures-- namely, Spongebob Squarepants, Patrick Star, Squidward Tentacles, Mr. Krabs, and Sandy Cheeks--as they navigate life in Bikini Bottom. Fun fact: Bikini Bottom is based off of a real-life coral reef in the Pacific Ocean, known as Bikini Atoll. As the series goes on, additional characters are added, including a live-action pirate named Patchy. Many episodes include narration from an unseen French omnicient, which is an ode to oceanographer Jacques Cousteau.
